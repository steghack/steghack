### Greetings, humans! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on becoming a Full Stack Developer ðŸ¤“ðŸ¥¸
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to master Javascript & Bootstrap (Nov 2023)
  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on most anything. There is always something to learn ðŸ§ , ways to improve ðŸ› , and opportunities to grow! ðŸŒ¿

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Yes, please. Though proper nouns are perfectly acceptable, as well.  "Call me Ishmael." 
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like fun facts! Such as, Facts and Factoids are not the same.                 
            - Factoid: "You swallow an average of eight spiders a year while sleeping."
            - Fact: The belief that you swallow eight spiders a year while sleeping is a myth; there's no scientific evidence to support it. Spiders generally avoid humans and their sleeping spaces.
